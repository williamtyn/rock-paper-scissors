<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>
The only bug i can find on the website is on the index.html. Because the script runs before the user have added a username. You can see in the console <em>"Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'innerHTML')".</em>. If i had more time i have made 2 separated script files to run the index javascript in a separated script file from where the game script runs.

<h3 id="unsolved-bugs">Unsolved Bugs/optimal features</h3>

#### Press enter to play
Today the user need to click "Enter Game!" with the mouse to play. In future features i will add eventlistener for enter so the player can enter their nickname and press enter to play.

#### Images to choices
I have added images rock, paper and scissor to images. I had a plan to add theese images to show instead of the text: Rock, Papper and Scissors in the "'Username'" Choice and "Computer Choise". Due to lack of deadlinetime and that this was not an expectation from the user or customer. I´v added this to future feature.

<h2 id="responsivness">Responsivness</h2>
The responsive design was tested with <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Chrome DevTools</a>. The testing of responsivness included Smartphones, Tablets and bigger screens. Media Queries was added in CSS for screens with 700px width and below.
